## Project Description
This tool was developed as a final project of the "Wireless network" course @ Universit√† degli Studi di Milano.
Our professor asked us to develop something intresting, innovative and creative regarding the wireless technologies tha we have studied during his coursework. 
I decided to build a small framework that will automate some of the tipical phases of the procedure that a penetration tester or a security expert have to perform in order to make a correct wireless network assessment.

### Wireless Assessment

phase 1 -> discovery with airodump integration and output parsing
phase 2 -> sensible informatino disclosure with regex based sniffer
phase 3 -> attacking the enterprise protocol WPA-PEAP with a fake access point 

## Project Technical Detail
