## Project Description
This tool was developed as a final project of the "Wireless network" course @ Universit√† degli Studi di Milano.
Our professor asked us to develop something intresting, innovative and creative regarding the wireless technologies tha we have studied during his coursework. 
I decided to build a small framework that will automate some of the tipical phases of the procedure that a penetration tester or a security expert have to perform in order to make a correct wireless network assessment.

## What can I do with the Wireless Mayhem Framework (WMF)
Thanks to Wireless Mayhem Framewoork you can automate some stpes of the wireless assessment procedure:

- **DISCOVER**: the WMF integration with airodump-ng, can discover any Wireless network that is near you and provide a user friendly output in order to speed up the reconnaissance and discovery phases.
- **ATTACK & CRACK**: WMF implements a Fake AP using the hostapd-wpe software, which, for example, is capable to simulate a PEAP-WPA Enterprise network Access Point and intercept the passwords hashes but it can be also configured for instantiate a simple fake AP useful for many other attacks.
- **ASSESS**: WMF actually provides three different sniffer filters based on regular expressions and the python's scapy library; with this configuration you only  have to choose what you want to sniff and the launch the tool. 

## Hardware
Wireless Mayhem is a python framework built for automate wireless attacks.
The main features are:
- Sniffing tools
- Fake Access Point based attacks

## Hardware
In my personal experience with wifi penetration testing, I suggest you to buy this external wifi antenna:

but any type of wireless network adapter, if capable of packet injection, should work well, just check the compatibilty list here:
