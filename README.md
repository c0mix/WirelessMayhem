## Project Description
This tool was developed as a final project of the "Wireless network" course @ Universit√† degli Studi di Milano.
Our professor asked us to develop something intresting, innovative and creative regarding the wireless technologies tha we have studied during his coursework. 
I decided to build a small framework that will automate some of the tipical phases of the procedure that a penetration tester or a security expert have to perform in order to make a correct wireless network assessment.

### What can i do with the Wireless Mayhem Framework (WMF)
Thanks to Wireless Mayhem Framewoork you can automate some stpes of the wireless assessment procedure:

- ##DISCOVER: WMF, integrationg with airodump-ng, can discover any Wireless network that is near you and provide a user friendly outup in order to speed up the reconnaissance and discovery phases.
- ATTACK & CRACK: WMF implements a Fake AP using the hostapd-wpe software that is capable, for exemple, to simulate e PEAP-WPA Enterprise network Access Point and intercept the password hashes but it can be configured for instantiete a simple Fake AP for many other attacks.
- phase 3 -> attacking the enterprise protocol WPA-PEAP with a fake access point 

## Project Technical Detail
Wireless Mayhem is a python framework built for automate wireless attacks.
The main features are:
- Sniffing tools
- Fake Access Point based attacks
